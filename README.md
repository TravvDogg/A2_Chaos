# How to run the sketch

1. Clone repo to your computer
2. open `index.html`
3. Make sure to allow microphone access
4. Play any song or audio into the microphone and enjoy the visuals
   
   **Make sure** to turn off noise cancellation, and allow microphone access.

### Try these
1. House or club music E.g. Daft Punk - Get Lucky
2. Calmer music E.g. The Marias - Fog as a bullet
   
  these songs i find show the seperate frequencies effects well, in their own ways. I encourage you to try it with your own music,
  I find that bass heavy music is fun, but more delicate and hi-fi music often works better.

> The louder you play the music, the more pronounced the visuals. This visualiser was tuned for conversation volume. Funky stuff happens if you go much higher (rubbing or blowing into mic), give it a go if you want!
