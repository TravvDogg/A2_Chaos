# How to run the sketch

1. Clone the repository to your computer.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Ensure microphone access is allowed and disable noise cancellation.  
4. Play any song or audio into the microphone and enjoy the visuals.  

### Try these

1. House or club music (e.g., Daft Punk â€“ â€˜Get Luckyâ€™)  
2. Calmer music (e.g., The MarÃ­as â€“ â€˜Fog as a Bulletâ€™)  

These tracks showcase the separate frequency effects in different ways. I encourage you to experiment with your own musicâ€”I find that bass-heavy tracks are fun, but more delicate, high-fidelity music often works best.

> The louder you play the music, the more pronounced the visuals. This visualiser was tuned for conversation volume. Funky stuff happens if you go much higher (rubbing or blowing into the mic)â€”give it a go if you want!
